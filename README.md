 <hr>

This site features lots of fanart from different artists. do not use without permission.

This site is live and accessible at [https://grat.gay/](https://grat.gay/)  </br>
this site has no backend, instead opting for a infomation file that is rebuilt semi often by the host server.  </br>
to generate a new info.js include ENV for a Twitch Token & a Twitch Client ID. this is so it can gather Grat10's broadcast status & schedule.

it also gathers file paths for any of the folders within images/media, so it will auto update the site with new images. alt text and credits are placed in metadata.json.

this is static website, using only base HTML, CSS & JS

included in metadata is:
- alt text
- link (usually linktree for an artist, website link for site badges)
- credit (creator of image)
- date 

This site also uses 
- Nyaplayer (music player at the top of the page)
- NyaGallery
- [Keymotes (for using social.grat.gay emotes)](https://codeberg.org/KiruPoruno/keymotes)

<hr>
