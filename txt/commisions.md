# Terms of service

"read them plz"

i take a pretty laid back look at commisions, so i try to be upfront about if and if i cannot do whats asked, and in that case your payment will be returned in full. :3

**You may:** do pretty much anything with the art i make for you! use in streams, thumbnails, projects, etc

**You may not:** use my art in any "WEB3" or AI scams, doing so will get you banned from ever commisioning me again.

**Note:** some commisions like the Hama-letter commisions are denmark only for the time being!

# Vtuber models

price: 100$ - 300$

I'll make you a custom model for use on your streams or videos!

i can rig your model in Inochi2D but i do not rig in Live2D anymore,
i give out a model file so you can get it rigged by someone else!

making a model takes me a long time so please be patient with me

extra things like toggles, outfits and such will cost extra

**Note:** please have a refrence sheet or provide refrence for what your model should look like/include

**Beware:** you should probably be fine with me stopping by your streams to lurk aswell :3

i try to keep the pixelart very clear so it will be easy to see at smaller sizes

#Some bigger artwork
