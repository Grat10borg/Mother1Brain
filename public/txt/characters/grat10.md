### Design notes.
---

##### **General theme**
Grat is designed sort of like early anime adaptations of robots,
obviously metalic but also with signiture "robot ears" and huge Antennas.

Grat is generally space themed too

##### **Head**
Grat hair color is lightblue, but can also be drawn cyan. and has two orange hair bands in it.
on the side of the head theres two yellow blinker lights, and a set of robot ears.
they can be animated as blicking in the direction Grat is about to look.

on top of the head theres two big Antennas with a yellow light at the top,
the antennas form a V shape sort of like an Axolotel.

in the middle top of the head theres a Hook, this is for lifting Grat.

Grat has orange eyes, when talking they turn yellow, eye highlights are purple, and eyeshadow is dark red

the scarf doubles as a bottom to Grats space helmet

Grat's Helmet activate animation.

##### **Body**
Grats body is a metalic white like their face but she wears a near black body suit which ends at the hands and neck.


on top she wears a gray long sleeved croptop, with light gray decorations and pink and purple highlights.
the sleaves always go down and covers most of the hands.

Grat also wears gray shorts with holes in the hips, and also has a tail with a power plug at the end.

Grat does not have feet, and it instead ends in spikes with a sort of heel look
theres also a orange band on the right leg.

##### **Grat Simplified**
due to the head decorations grat is quite easilly recognisable with just a blue color and pink blush,
as long as the antenna and hook is also drawn.

##### Inspiration for design

Grats ear shapes are quite simmilar to [Nymph's from Heaven's Lost Property](https://www.anime-planet.com/characters/nymph) 
(it's a lewd and old anime beware.)

Grats Antenna was inspired by Axolotels,
the rest of the design came from mixing spacesuits with Illu's outfit
